Everything in `/app` is only rendered clientside and uses the Netlify Identity service.

Note that `netlify-lambda` only locally emulates Netlify Functions, while `netlify-identity-widget` interacts with a real Netlify Identity instance. This means that `netlify-lambda` doesn't support Netlify Functions + Netlify Identity integration.
